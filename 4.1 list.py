#List and its functions
#Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#Lists are created using square brackets [] and can contain different data types.

#Example of a list
#Write a program to demonstrate list creation and manipulation.
#Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content.
list1 = ["Apple","Banana", "Cherry",404, 5.6, True]

print(list1[0])
#Print the first element of list1
list1[0]="Mango"  #Lists are mutable, so we can change the elements of the list
print(list1[0])
#Original list1 changes and prints "Mango"
